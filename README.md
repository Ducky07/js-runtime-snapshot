# JavaScript Runtime Benchmarks

## Runtime testing at the end of 2025 (03.11.2025)

_**Note:** All results were obtained using a M2 Macbook Air, with macOS version 26.0.1 Tahoe.
These tests are not meant to be perfect, more just a comparison to see roughly where these runtimes will land in on the spectrum.
It is recommended to do your own testing and compare results elsewhere.
Lastly, I will mention that these results are not entirely fair towards Deno, since I did not implement all of these tests with Denos native APIs in mind (see native chart and tests/http-test-deno file)._

**Node.js version: 24.10.0**

**Deno version: 2.5.6**

**Bun version: 1.3.1**
